/**
 * A rendering guard for the sub-11 dev plan's tables.
 *
 * Two defects hid in that file for many phases, both invisible in the raw text being edited:
 *
 *  1. A BLANK LINE between two table rows ENDS the table in markdown. Nine of them had crept into
 *     the execution record, so it rendered as 13 rows and everything after phase 13 — including
 *     phase 32's own row — came out as literal paragraphs beginning with '|'.
 *  2. A literal '|' inside a cell splits that cell, and backticks give no protection. The GFM
 *     tables spec requires `\|` even inside a code span (spec example 200). Eight rows carried
 *     unescaped pipes in fact ids and shell snippets, shifting their evidence column out of place.
 *
 * Neither is visible until the file is rendered, and both are easy to reintroduce while appending
 * verification records — which is exactly what phases 33-38 will keep doing. Hence a guard.
