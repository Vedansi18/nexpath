/**
 * HV-1 (dev-plan §14.2) — the check-1/check-2 measurements for rows 1 and 4, pinned.
 *
 * These are MEASUREMENTS, not fixes: §14.3's frame says a failure here is a bug against the owning
 * group and "H patches nothing". They exist so HV-3's verdict table judges the state that actually
 * shipped, and so the gap cannot quietly change — in either direction — before it is judged.
 *
 * The finding: the auto path PROBES the project every session (`recordEnvTrajectory`), and PE still
 * receives zero env facts, because the probe result is written to the trajectory store while PE
 * reads the env-facts store that only `nexpath env` writes.
