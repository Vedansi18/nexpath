 * source-backed specifics…` — which is Nexpath instructing itself, not anything about the developer's
 * request. It survived the 2026-09-27 census because the object gate was refusing it in every body,
 * so the census counted a verb whose marks never reached a screen. Removing it costs 4 marks and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * ⏪ **Widened 2026-09-27** by `cover`, `document`, `gather`, `define`, `specify` — counted, not
 * chosen. Across 35 recorded bodies, 273 clause openings outside the never-marked sections were
 * censused and only **14** matched any shipped list; these five are the verbs that turned up and that

 * verbs a step list uses. They were worth nothing on their own and are only worth something beside
 * the sentence scan in {@link classOneOfLine}: a step list is written as one line, and until that

 *   **39 of those 55 appear exactly ONCE (71 %)**
 *
 * A tail that shape does not get shorter by being sampled. Adding the four verbs the three reported
