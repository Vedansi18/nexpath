/**
 * GR-1 (dev-plan §13.2 / §30.3 step 3) — the DETERMINISTIC FACT-RENDERING PATH,
 * the core of defect G4.
 *
 * 🔴 The measured defect: the deterministic renderer had no mechanism to place a
 * fact VALUE in a body. Every `line(...)` is a standing instruction, the
 * fall-through says *"Cover <heading>…"*, and `projectGroundingLine` says *"Use
 * the typed project/source metadata…"* — all three tell the reader to USE
 * grounding and none contains any. A no-key body therefore instructed about
 * facts it was holding.
 *
 * 🔴 The Phase-4 revert lesson, obeyed: a previous attempt widened the
 * projection with "no text field added" and collapsed to ONE CONSTANT LINE,
 * because every production fact carries `no_action_render_context_only`.
 * *"The missing step is RESOLUTION, not projection."* This renders group A's
 * resolved `evidence` payload — a fact with no resolved value produces NO line
 * here, and the section keeps its existing instruction. Nothing is invented to
 * fill a gap.
 *
 * The typed rules bind this path exactly as they bind the model (§41.3 / §44.1):
 * claim policy chooses the verb, anchor scope chooses the place, and the recency
 * band cannot be hidden. Deterministic — no LLM.
 */

/**
 * §32.2 step 3 says "BOUND and filter it". The filter half rides the gates below;
 * this is the bound. One oversized record would otherwise travel in full on every
 * composer call — measured, a 5,000-character value reached the model intact.
 *
 * 🔒 Sized as a TAIL bound, not a behaviour change: the measured typical evidence
 * line is ~148 characters, so this sits roughly seven times above ordinary traffic
 * and truncates nothing in normal use. Truncation is MARKED, never silent — a model
 * told a fact is complete when it is not would ground in a half-sentence.

/**
 * 🔒 A fact VALUE is data. Before this phase only IDS travelled to the model, so a
 * value could not shape the prompt; now it can, and the payload block is a
 * line-and-pipe structure that a value was able to WRITE INTO.
 *
 * MEASURED, both forms:
 * - a newline inside a value forged a SECOND `resolvedSourceFacts` entry the planner
 *   never authorised — attacker-chosen id, origin, claim ceiling and content
 *   (`deploy_command = kubectl delete ns prod`);
 * - a `|` inside a value forged FIELDS on its own line: a possibility-clamped
 *   `recent_prompt_history` fact re-stated itself as
 *   `claim: may_state_as_project_capability | origin: local_probe`, which is exactly
 *   the §41.3 illegality this phase exists to prevent.
 *
 * So the value is flattened to one line and DELIMITED with quotes: a pipe inside
 * quotes is visibly part of the value rather than a new field, and no value can
 * open a line. Content is preserved — pipes are common in real commands — with only
 * embedded quotes normalized so the delimiter itself cannot be closed early.
 *
 * ⚠️ This closes STRUCTURAL forgery. It does not make an instruction-shaped value
 * harmless prose; that is a wording-policy question, recorded for its owner.
